ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Dipanshu Maddheshiya!ðŸš€

Iâ€™m a Java Developer with a keen interest in DevOps, currently working at Carelon global solutions Company. With 2+ years of experience in developing and optimizing software solutions, I enjoy crafting clean, efficient code while automating processes to enhance productivity.

As a final-year engineering student, I thrive on the challenge of solving complex problems, whether it's debugging Java code or setting up CI/CD pipelines. I believe in a proactive approachâ€”first tackling problems head-on, then seeking insights from mentors or family when needed.

ðŸ”§ Skills & Interest:

Java Development: Core Java, Spring Boot, Hibernate, RESTful APIs

DevOps: CI/CD, Automation, AWS Cloud, Infrastructure as Code

Software Engineering: Object-Oriented Design, Clean Code, Agile Methodologies

Continuous Learning: Exploring the latest in Java frameworks and DevOps tools

ðŸ’¡ Personal Philosophy:

while (!succeed) {
 try();
 skill++;
}

When I'm not coding, youâ€™ll find me solving math problems, hitting the gym, or sharing my tech journey on Instagram. Letâ€™s connect and create impactful software solutions together!
