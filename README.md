ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Dipanshu Maddheshiya!ðŸš€

Iâ€™m an MLOps/DevOps/Cloud Engineer with a keen interest in automating and optimizing machine learning and software development workflows, currently working at Carelon Global Solutions. With 2+ years of experience in developing and optimizing software solutions, I enjoy crafting clean, efficient code while automating processes to enhance productivity.

As a final-year engineering student, I thrive on the challenge of solving complex problems, whether it's debugging machine learning models or setting up CI/CD pipelines. I believe in a proactive approachâ€”first tackling problems head-on, then seeking insights from mentors or family when needed.

ðŸ”§ Skills & Interests:

MLOps: Model Deployment, Data Pipelines, Experiment Tracking, Automation

DevOps: CI/CD, Automation, Infrastructure as Code, Containerization 

Cloud Engineering: AWS, Azure, GCP, Cloud-Native Architectures, Serverless Computing

Software Engineering: Object-Oriented Design, Clean Code, Agile Methodologies

Continuous Learning: Exploring the latest in MLOps frameworks, DevOps tools, and cloud technologies

ðŸ’¡ Personal Philosophy:

while (!succeed) {
try();
skill++;
}

When I'm not coding, youâ€™ll find me solving math problems, hitting the gym, or sharing my tech journey on Instagram. Letâ€™s connect and create impactful software solutions together!
